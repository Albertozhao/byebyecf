To the best coworkers ever

###### **Kristian** <br>

You are the best manager I've ever had. Probably will be that way for the rest of my career.

---

###### **Adam** <br>
You are the hardest working and most brilliant person I've stumbled across while working here. You make everyone feel like ðŸ¤¯.

---

###### **Jon** <br>
I learned so much from you. A bit OP that you're such an amazing communicator _and_ engineer.

---

###### **Gift** <br>
So, so happy every time my Youtube algo suggests your videos. Can't wait to learn about new stuff from the outside thanks to you.

---

###### **Obinna** <br>
Your personality is infectious and keeps everyone around you jolly. Grateful for your technical expertise too.

---

###### **Kate** <br>
Not only are our docs are 999% better, but feels like everything across the Workers team is that much better because of you.

---

###### **Rita** <br>
You are the most _boss_ person I've ever worked with. It was such a learning experience seeing you in any meeting, Bitbucket repo, and wiki.

###### **Aly** <br>
I have you to thank for everything - just an inspiration to learn from and always giving the best advice.
